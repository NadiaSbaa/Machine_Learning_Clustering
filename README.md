# Machine_Learning_Clustering
<h2> Implementation of two clustering methods </h2>
Introduction to models learned in clustering.

<h2> Dataset : </h2>
Using "fromage.txt" dataset which includes 29 instances of cheese, represented by 9 attributes (calories, sodium, calcium, lipids, retinol, folates, proteins,
cholesterol and magnesium). 

<h2> Mission : </h2>
The main objective of unsupervised learning methods is to group together close elements in the same group in a way that two elements of the same group are as similar as possible and that two elements from two different groups be as dissimilar as possible. We therefore seek to minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance. 

<h2>Hierarchical Ascending Classification  : </h2>
Hierarchical cluster analysis (or hierarchical clustering) is a general approach to cluster analysis. A key component of the analysis is repeated calculation of distance measures between objects, and between clusters once objects begin to be grouped into clusters. The outcome is represented graphically as a dendrogram

<h2>K-Means : </h2>
The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data. This can be used to confirm business assumptions about what types of groups exist or to identify unknown groups in complex data sets.
